Mr. Squidward’s League Constitution
*Amendments for each season at the bottom*
Welcome to our FUN league! By participating, you agree to abide by the following rules and guidelines. Any concerns or issues regarding these rules must be raised; failure to do so implies your acceptance of them. All matters not explicitly addressed will be resolved at the discretion of the commissioner, whose decisions are final. Our aim is to foster a fun, fair, and competitive environment, and we expect your cooperation and sportsmanship throughout the season. 
 
Article I – League Governance
1. Commissioner Role:
   - The founding commissioner is established, with subsequent commissioners to be elected through a vote by league members.
   - The commissioner is the primary authority and handles disputes, rule violations, and overall league management.
   - The commissioner’s decisions are final unless otherwise specified by a super majority (2/3rds) vote of league members.
2. Voting:
   - Major rule changes or decisions can be put to a vote. Each team will have one vote. Commish gets two if there is a tie breaker. Super majority (2/3rds) vote of league members.

 Article II – Team and Roster Management
1. Team Size:
   - Number of teams: 16
   - Roster spots per team: 10
   - Positions: G, F, C, Flex, Bench
2. Daily Lineup:
   - 3 guards, 3 forwards, 2 center, 2 flex
3. Injured List (IL) Restrictions:
   - 2 IL slots
   - Players placed on IL must be removed within one week plus the remaining days in the current period once they become healthy.
   - Failure to remove healthy players from IL will result in a complete restriction from making any transactions (lineup adjustments, claims, trades, or other moves).
   - Unforeseen Circumstances: If unforeseen circumstances arise, it is understood that the affected team will be at a disadvantage; "suck it up."
   - Anti-Stash Rule: Players without an injury designation (red flag) may remain on IL for a maximum of 2 full weeks. After this period, if the player is not activated or dropped, the team will be completely locked from all transactions until the roster is corrected.

 Article III – Draft
1. Format: Auction draft
2. Budget per team: $200
3. Maximum bid per player: Budget minus remaining players ($1 per player minimum)
4. Draft timing: Before the start of the season
5. If you miss a draft pick due to technical reasons, you must reach out to the commissioner right away. If it is determined to be a bug, the pick will be reverted to the price and person that paid for it and the time will resume from 15 seconds. If it was a failure due to a connection issue or not paying attention, you're SOL. 
6. Commissioner's Discretion: Anything missed by these rules will be determined by the commissioner. 
7. Draft Order: Draft order will be determined at least 5 minutes before the draft begins.
The previous season's champion has the option to reroll the order twice if they choose to do so.
The process follows: Order A (initial randomization), Reroll B, or Reroll C.
The champion must accept the final order that is generated. Once a reroll is used, they cannot revert to a previous order. 
They have 10s-15s to decide if they want to stick with it or reroll. The default is to choose the 3rd one.
8. Matchup Schedule:
The regular season matchup schedule will be determined at least 15 minutes before the draft begins.
Similar reroll rules apply as the draft order: the previous champion chooses how many rerolls we do then we land on the final schedule.
They have 10s-15s to decide if they want to stick with it or reroll. The default is to choose the 3rd one.

2. Additional Rules for Insurance (Added Jan 28, 2025)

It can be discussed in terms that it does happen automatically.
2 - If it was a multi team trade, the policy will only apply to the managers accepting the policy.
3 - You may trade players already under an insurance policy, but you must say so to the new manager and they must know the risk that the player may be reverted back to its original owner.
4 - If two policies are activated, only one manager needs to decide to use it for the trade to be reversed. No canceling out the other’s policy by using your own (like burns in president)

Amendment Two - 25/26 Season Updates

Clarification on "Games Played" Minimums (Bench Technicals/0-Minute Stats):
Specific Ruling for Week of Nov 3, 2025 (Aaron Gordon Incident): For this unique, unforeseen event, the -6 fantasy point game incurred by Aaron Gordon's bench technical foul will be removed from the team's score. This specific game will not count towards the weekly 'Games Played' minimum for the affected team. This is a one-time ruling to address an exceptional circumstance.
Effective Next Week Onward: If a player is placed in an active roster spot and is officially listed as participating in an NBA game (even if they log 0 actual playing minutes), and they accumulate any fantasy-relevant stats (e.g., a technical foul, ejection, etc.), this will count as a 'game played' towards the weekly minimum. All associated fantasy points (positive or negative) will also count. The fantasy platform's official recording of stats for a player will dictate if a game is considered 'played' for minimum purposes.
