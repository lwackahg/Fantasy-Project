# 6. Future Ideas and Roadmap

This document is a living collection of ideas for future features, optimizations, and the long-term vision for the Fantasy Trade Analyzer.

## 6.1. Potential New Features

-   **Fantrax API Integration**: Directly connect to the Fantrax API to automatically sync league data, including rosters, standings, and draft results. This would eliminate the need for manual CSV uploads.
-   **Multi-League Support**: Allow users to manage and switch between multiple fantasy leagues within the same account.
-   **Keeper League Tools**: Add features specifically for keeper leagues, such as analyzing the cost/benefit of keeping certain players.
-   **Historical Draft Analysis**: Allow users to upload past draft data to analyze what strategies were most successful.
-   **Waiver Wire Assistant**: A tool that suggests the best players to pick up from the waiver wire based on team needs and player performance trends.

## 6.2. Technical Enhancements

-   **Async Operations**: Convert long-running calculations (like the team optimizer) to asynchronous operations to prevent the UI from freezing.
-   **Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching (e.g., with Redis) to store the results of expensive calculations and speed up the application.
-   **Database Backend**: Replace the CSV-based data storage with a proper database (like PostgreSQL or SQLite) for more robust data management.
-   **Component-Based UI**: Refactor the UI into a more formal component-based structure to improve reusability and maintainability.

## 6.4. Platform and Data Enhancements

-   **Unified Data Querying Interface**: Develop a centralized module or class that provides a simple, powerful interface for querying any of the loaded CSV data (player stats, schedules, draft results, etc.). This would abstract away the direct DataFrame manipulation and allow for more complex, cross-data-source queries. For example, `data.query('player_stats', filters={'position': 'PG', 'age': '<25'})` or `data.query('schedule', filters={'team': 'Team A', 'outcome': 'win'})`. This would greatly simplify feature development and enhance data exploration capabilities.

## 6.3. Long-Term Vision

The ultimate goal is to evolve the Fantasy Trade Analyzer into a comprehensive, all-in-one fantasy basketball management platform. It should be the go-to resource for everything from draft preparation to in-season management, providing unparalleled data-driven insights to help users dominate their leagues.
