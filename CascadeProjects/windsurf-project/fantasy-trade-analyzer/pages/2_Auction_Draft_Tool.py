        ### Core Player Valuations
        - **Base Value**: Calculated from player projections using a z-score methodology against a replacement-level player. This is a stable, pre-draft valuation.
        - **Market Value**: Reflects the expected auction price based on data from similar leagues.
        - **Adjusted Value (In-Draft)**: This is the most important number. It adjusts the Base Value in real-time based on:
            - **Positional Scarcity**: As players at a certain position are drafted, the value of remaining players at that position increases.
            - **Inflation/Deflation**: The model tracks the total money spent versus the total value of players drafted. If teams overpay, inflation occurs, and the value of remaining players goes up. If players are acquired for less than their value, deflation occurs.
        - **VORP (Value Over Replacement Player)**: A measure of how much a player is expected to contribute beyond a readily available replacement player.

        ### Smart Auction Bot Logic
        The bot provides two types of recommendations:
        - **Nomination Advice**: This is a strategic recommendation for who you should nominate next. It is based on the overall state of the draft and does not change when you select different players in the dropdown below. The bot uses several tactics:
            - **Target High Value**: Recommends a player who provides the highest *marginal value* specifically for your team's build.
            - **Pressure Opponents**: Suggests nominating a top player you don't need to force other teams to spend their budget.
            - **Find a Bargain**: Identifies players with high potential (VORP) relative to their expected cost.
        - **Bidding Advice**: This advice appears when a player is 'On The Block'. The bot calculates a **Max Bid** based on:
            - The player's **Adjusted Value**.
            - The player's **Marginal Value**: The bot runs a rapid simulation to measure how much that specific player improves your team's optimal lineup. A high marginal value means the player is a perfect fit for your roster, justifying a higher bid.
