## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages (installed automatically):
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - plotly
  - numpy

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using the Batch File
1. Double-click `run_app.bat` in the project directory
2. The application will open in your default web browser

#### Option 2: Using Command Line
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run:
```bash
python -m streamlit run src/app.py
```

## Fantrax API Integration

To enable data fetching from the Fantrax API, ensure you have set up your API key in the `.env` file located in the project directory. The key should be set as follows:

```
FANTRAX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Accessing Private League Data

To access private league data, follow these steps:

1. **Automate Login with Selenium**:
   - Run the `fantrax_login.py` script to open a Chrome browser and log in to Fantrax. This will save your session cookies to a file.
   - Ensure you have `selenium` and `webdriver-manager` installed.
   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Use Cookies with Fantrax API**:
   - Run the `fantrax_api_access.py` script to load the saved cookies and connect to the Fantrax API.
   - Update the script with your league ID to access specific league data.

These steps allow you to authenticate and access private league data using the Fantrax API.

## Connecting to a Private League

To connect to a private league or access specific pages in a public league that are not public, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Ensure you have `selenium` and `webdriver-manager` installed:
```bash
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
```

### Step 2: Automate Login and Save Cookies
Use the following script to log in to Fantrax and save your session cookies:
```python
import pickle
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

options = Options()
options.add_argument("--window-size=1920,1600")
options.add_argument("user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36")

with webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options) as driver:
    driver.get("https://www.fantrax.com/login")
    time.sleep(30)  # Wait for the user to log in
    pickle.dump(driver.get_cookies(), open("fantraxloggedin.cookie", "wb"))
```

### Step 3: Use Cookies with Fantrax API
Load the saved cookies into a session and use it with the Fantrax API:
```python
import pickle
from fantraxapi import FantraxAPI
from requests import Session

session = Session()

with open("fantraxloggedin.cookie", "rb") as f:
    for cookie in pickle.load(f):
        session.cookies.set(cookie["name"], cookie["value"])

league_id = "96igs4677sgjk7ol"

api = FantraxAPI(league_id, session=session)

print(api.trade_block())  # Access the private Trade Block page
```

This process allows you to authenticate with Fantrax and access private league data using the Fantrax API.

## Data Files

The analyzer expects Fantrax export files in CSV format. 

### File Naming Convention
- Files should end with (X).csv where X is the number of days
- Examples:
  - `any-name-(7).csv` for 7-day stats
  - `stats-(14).csv` for 14-day stats
  - `data-(30).csv` for 30-day stats
  - `export-(60).csv` for 60-day stats

### Required Data Format
The CSV files must contain the following required columns:
- `Player`: Player name
- `Team`: Team abbreviation (will be converted to full name)
- `FP/G`: Fantasy points per game

Additional recommended columns for full functionality:
- `FPts`: Total fantasy points
- `MIN`: Minutes played
- `PTS`: Points scored
- `REB`: Total rebounds
- `AST`: Assists
- `STL`: Steals
- `BLK`: Blocks
- `TOV`: Turnovers

### Data Directory
Place your CSV files in the `data/` directory of the project. The analyzer will automatically detect and load files with the correct naming format.

### Exporting Data from Fantrax
1. Go to your Fantrax league
2. Navigate to the Players page
3. Click on "Download to CSV"
4. Save the file with the appropriate naming convention in the data directory
5. Repeat for different time ranges (7, 14, 30, 60 days)

### Common Data Issues
If you encounter issues loading data:
1. Check that your CSV files follow the correct naming convention with (X) days
2. Verify that all required columns are present
3. Ensure numeric columns contain valid numbers
4. Make sure the files are placed in the `data/` directory

## Usage

1. Select number of teams involved (2-5)
2. Choose teams from the dropdowns
3. Select players to trade from each team
4. Choose which players each team receives
5. Click "Analyze Trade" to see:
   - Trade fairness score
   - Before/After comparisons
   - Position impact
   - Statistical changes
