## 1. My Approach: Use The Rules
To address various coding issues, I've been experimenting with Windsurf's global and workspace AI rules. The purpose of these rules is to create a standardized set of guidelines that help the AI align with my coding preferences. Global AI rules apply to all projects, while workspace-specific rules cater to individual project needs. Although I am still exploring the best practices, I believe this framework can improve the interaction between the AI and my coding workflows.

## 2. Helpful Tips for Prompting Windsurf
Here are some effective strategies that have helped me when using Windsurf:

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions to receive the best results.
- **Break It Down**: For complex problems, divide the task into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Review**: Always review the generated code; not every situation requires it, but quality checks are beneficial.
- **One Step at a Time**: Tackle problems incrementally rather than all at once.
- **Be Careful with Costs**: Monitor the usage of credits. Aim to solve simpler issues locally to avoid unnecessary API requests.
- **Avoid Over Complicating Things**: Prioritize simpler solutions as they tend to produce fewer complications.
- **Do Not Change Base Functionality**: When possible, avoid changing the base functionality of the given code.

## 3. Example Prompts
These examples demonstrate how to effectively communicate with Windsurf, even with a limited technical background:

### Adding a New Feature
**Prompt**: "Based on my feature plan, implement the login page. It should include email and password fields, be responsive, and handle errors gracefully. Please adhere to the authentication methods specified in the auth_methods.md file."

### Making Changes
**Prompt**: "Refactor the user management code to improve its modularity. Consult the project guidelines and ensure no changes are made to the existing functionality. Implement the changes step by step."

### Debugging
**Prompt**: "I'm encountering an error when submitting the form. Please debug the issue using the terminal output and apply small, incremental fixes to achieve the desired outcome."


### Before responding:

Review the complete README noted in this project’s project notes. You have read and write access to these folders and files. READ ALL OF IT. Note the philosophy and step by step approach as we systematically rebuild this app. Scan and read the critical files like app.py.

Complete the STOP AND VERIFY checklist:    - Identify Impact Area    - Note Current State    - Plan Single Change    - Verify Theme Generation (if applicable)

Confirm we’re on Step [current step] and not jumping ahead
